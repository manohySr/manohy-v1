      <span>Hi there! Still Manohy here, a passionate software engineer who loves to build things for the web(sometime useless, but still beautifull). Whether it is coding up a storm or crafting a smooth user experience, I am all in. Software is my playground, and I enjoy solving problems one line at a time. Let\'s make something amazing together! <br/>
      My journey into software engineering began in 2022 when I decided to dive into the world of hackathons <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Techzara/photos/a.152154345343592/1100115003880850/?type=3&app=fbl">@HIU</a>. I joined my school team at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Techzara/photos/a.152154345343592/1100115003880850/?type=3&app=fbl" target="_blank">@ESPA</a> and I was hooked. I tackled frontend development using React, HTML, and CSS, and the experience ignited my passion for building digital products that matter. <br/>
      I hold a Master's Degree in Telecommunication Engineering, which gave me a solid foundation in tech and problem-solving. Over the past two years, I have honed my skills as a full-stack developer, working with diverse technologies to create high-quality, user-centric applications. <br/>
      Lately, I have been diving into a wide range of exciting technologies, and I am always excited to learn more and expand my toolkit. Here's a quick look at what I have ve been working with recently:
